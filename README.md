# riken-workshop
This repository contains the code for the RIKEN workshop on Characterization-based Error Mitigation for Quantum Computation, using the qedma_riken and qedma_api packages (provided as pre-built .whl files) or the public qedma_api package.

* Clone the repository and run either qesem_lab_qedma_api.ipynb or qesem_lab_qedma_riken.ipynb to begin the workshop.
* The .whl for qedma_riken and qedma_api can be installed using the command provided at the start of qesem_lab_qedma_riken.ipynb notebook.
* The required Python packages are listed at the start of both of the notebooks, along with the installation command:
  pip install "qiskit>=2.0.0" "qiskit-ibm-runtime>=0.40.0" "qiskit-aer>=0.17.1" "networkx>=3.5" "matplotlib==3.10.0" "tqdm>=4.67.1" "scipy" "numpy" "python-dotenv==1.2.1" "pylatexenc>=2.10" 
 and for the qesem_lab_solution_qedma_api.ipynb you also need "qedma-api==0.18.3".
* Reference solutions are available in qesem_lab_solution_qedma_api.ipynb and qesem_lab_solution_qedma_riken.ipynb.
